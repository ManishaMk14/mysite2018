            <h1>Why choose a cruelty free life?</h1>
            <p>
                    In the United States alone, more than 100 million animals are tortured and killed each 
                    year for animal testing. And you can help! There’s one huge industry that’s responsible 
                    for a big chunk of the animal testing going on, and that’s the cosmetics industry. 
                    By buying cruelty-free cosmetics, you can help put an end to this horrific practice.

                Some companies test experimental chemicals on animals to prevent any kind of product from 
                harming humans. This means that an animal is often subjected to potentially toxic materials 
                that could prematurely end its life.
